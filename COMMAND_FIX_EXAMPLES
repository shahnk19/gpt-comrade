  The error message suggests that the Python library required by the AWS CLI is not found in the expected path. This issue can arise if you have recently updated your Python version or if there is an issue with your AWS CLI installation.

  1. Update AWS CLI: Update AWS CLI to the latest version. You can run the following command in your terminal to update your AWS CLI installation.

     ```
     pip install --upgrade awscli
     ```

  2. Reinstall AWS CLI: If updating AWS CLI does not fix the issue, then try reinstalling it.

     ```
     curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
     sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
     ```

  3. Verify Python installation: Verify that Python is installed and functioning correctly on your system. You can run the following command to check the Python version.
